# Arduino-uno-IR-Sensor
The Arduino Uno IR Sensor detects infrared (IR) radiation emitted by objects. It typically includes an IR transmitter and receiver pair, with the receiver detecting reflected IR light. This enables applications such as proximity sensing, object detection, and obstacle avoidance in robotics and automation projects.
